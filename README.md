# .NET Standard 2.0 Cookbook
This is the code repository for [.NET Standard 2.0 Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/net-standard-20-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788834667), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
With the latest version of .NET, Microsoft has standardized the entire platform for Core, the Framework, as well as Xamarin. The .NET Standard is a standard that represents a set of APIs that all .NET platforms have to implement, making it easy for developers to access and use one common library for their development needs.If you want to get the best out of the .NET framework using the standard libraries and programs, then this book is for you.

The .NET Standard 2.0 Cookbook begins with a quick refresher, and the book will help you understand the mechanics of the new standard and offers insight into how it works. You will explore the core library concepts - such as working with collections, configurations, I/O, security, and multithreading. Youâ€™ll will explore the iOS and Android libraries of Xamarin and guide you through to creating a .NET Standard 2.0 library and use it with both Android and iOS applications. In the concluding chapters, you will learn the various debugging and diagnostics tools to deliver quality libraries and create a NuGet package of the .NET Standard 2.0 library.

By the end of this book, you will have gain the ability to expand your current workflow to various .NET flavors and obtain the essential skills to create a .NET Standard 2.0 library from scratch to package and deliver it to the world.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
public void WriteLog(string message)
{
logFile.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now} Log Message: {message} ");
}
```

This book assumes that readers have basic knowledge of C#. Also, it assumes basic knowledge of using Visual Studio, installing packages using NuGet, and referencing libraries within projects from other projects.

Basic knowledge of using command-line tools such as bash on Ubuntu and terminal in macOS will be an added advantage but not a must.
